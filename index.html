                    It is hard to understate just how much Napoleon changed Europe. His reign over much of Europe led to higher political consciousness and the spread of Romanticism. 
                    Slowly but surely, established systems, for example the power of the church or feudalism, lost ground to various new ideals and ideologies, not always without a fight.
                    Still, Napoleon eventually lost and the borders were redrawn. Reactionary forces had taken control of Europe once again, but the impact could not be reversed. 
                    Accompanied by the Industrial Revolution, the world was heading towards a new era of uncertainty, conflict and innovation.
